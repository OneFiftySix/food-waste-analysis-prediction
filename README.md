# Food Waste Analysis & Prediction

This data science project analyzes global food waste patterns, identifies key causes, and uses machine learning to predict total food waste.

The goal is to answer:
- How much food is being wasted?
- Why is food being wasted?
- How can food waste be reduced?

## Dataset
Data sources:
- Kaggle
- DataCamp

Key features include:
- Country, Region
- Food Category
- Supply Stage
- Population
- Economic Loss
- Household Waste
- **Total Waste in Tons (Target Variable)**

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Machine Learning models:
  - Random Forest (final model)
  - Other baseline models for comparison

## Results
- Identified high-risk countries and food categories
- Household and retail stages contribute significantly to waste
- Random Forest achieved the best performance with lowest error

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Takeaways
- Predictive modeling helps target waste reduction efforts
- Insights can inform policy and supply chain optimization
- Data-driven approaches are essential for sustainability
